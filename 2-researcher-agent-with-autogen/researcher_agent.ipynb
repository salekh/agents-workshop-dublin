            "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a way of teaching machines to make decisions by interacting with their environment. Think of it like training a dog: the dog (agent) performs actions (e.g., sitting, fetching) in response to commands (environment). If the dog does well, it gets a treat (reward); if not, it gets no treat or a correction. Over time, the dog learns which actions lead to rewards and becomes better at performing them.\n",
            "\n",
            "In RL, the \"agent\" is the learner (like the dog), the \"environment\" is the world it interacts with, \"actions\" are the choices it makes, and \"rewards\" are the feedback it gets for its actions. The goal is to maximize rewards over time by learning the best actions to take in different situations.\n",

However, human feedback can often be noisy,\\ninconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such\\nfeedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended\\nside effects during the RLHF process.

We introduce Multi-agent\\nReinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality (M3HF),\\na novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality\\ninto the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise\\nlevels to provide iterative guidance, M3HF leverages both expert and non-expert\\nfeedback to continuously refine agents' policies.

However, they struggle with learning inefficiencies in\\ntackling real-world complex sequential decision-making tasks, especially with\\nsparse reward signals and long-horizon dependencies. To effectively address the\\nissue, we introduce Variational Subgoal-Conditioned RL (VSC-RL), which\\nreformulates the vision-language sequential decision-making task as a\\nvariational goal-conditioned RL problem, allowing us to leverage advanced\\noptimization methods to enhance learning efficiency. Specifically, VSC-RL\\noptimizes the SubGoal Evidence Lower BOund (SGC-ELBO), which consists of (a)\\nmaximizing the subgoal-conditioned return via RL and (b) minimizing the\\nsubgoal-conditioned difference with the reference policy. We theoretically\\ndemonstrate that SGC-ELBO is equivalent to the original optimization objective,\\nensuring improved learning efficiency without sacrificing performance\\nguarantees. Additionally, for real-world complex decision-making tasks, VSC-RL\\nleverages the vision-language model to autonomously decompose the goal into\\nfeasible subgoals, enabling efficient learning. Across various benchmarks,\\nincluding challenging real-world mobile device control tasks, VSC-RL\\nsignificantly outperforms the SOTA vision-language agents, achieving superior\\nperformance and remarkable improvement in learning efficiency.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-03-21\\nTitle: NotaGen: Advancing Musicality in Symbolic Music Generation with Large Language Model Training Paradigms\\nAuthors: Yashan Wang, Shangda Wu, Jianhuai Hu, Xingjian Du, Yueqi Peng, Yongxin Huang, Shuai Fan, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Maosong Sun\\nSummary: We introduce NotaGen, a symbolic music generation model aiming to explore the\\npotential of producing high-quality classical sheet music.

Foundational Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) excel at fast decision-making but lack the depth for\\ncomplex reasoning, as they have not yet fully embraced the step-by-step\\nanalysis characteristic of true System 2 thinking. Recently, reasoning LLMs\\nlike OpenAI's o1/o3 and DeepSeek's R1 have demonstrated expert-level\\nperformance in fields such as mathematics and coding, closely mimicking the\\ndeliberate reasoning of System 2 and showcasing human-like cognitive abilities.\\nThis survey begins with a brief overview of the progress in foundational LLMs\\nand the early development of System 2 technologies, exploring how their\\ncombination has paved the way for reasoning LLMs. Next, we discuss how to\\nconstruct reasoning LLMs, analyzing their features, the core methods enabling\\nadvanced reasoning, and the evolution of various reasoning LLMs. Additionally,\\nwe provide an overview of reasoning benchmarks, offering an in-depth comparison\\nof the performance of representative reasoning LLMs. Finally, we explore\\npromising directions for advancing reasoning LLMs and maintain a real-time\\n\\\\href{https://github.com/zzli2022/Awesome-Slow-Reason-System}{GitHub\\nRepository} to track the latest developments.

However,\\ntheir application in professional medical contexts remains underexplored,\\nparticularly in evaluating the quality of their reasoning processes alongside\\nfinal outputs. Here, we introduce MedR-Bench, a benchmarking dataset of 1,453\\nstructured patient cases, annotated with reasoning references derived from\\nclinical case reports. Spanning 13 body systems and 10 specialties, it includes\\nboth common and rare diseases. To comprehensively evaluate LLM performance, we\\npropose a framework encompassing three critical examination recommendation,\\ndiagnostic decision-making, and treatment planning, simulating the entire\\npatient care journey. To assess reasoning quality, we present the Reasoning\\nEvaluator, a novel automated system that objectively scores free-text reasoning\\nresponses based on efficiency, actuality, and completeness using dynamic\\ncross-referencing and evidence checks. Using this benchmark, we evaluate five\\nstate-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, and\\nGemini-2.0-Flash Thinking, etc. Our results show that current LLMs achieve over\\n85% accuracy in relatively simple diagnostic tasks when provided with\\nsufficient examination results. However, performance declines in more complex\\ntasks, such as examination recommendation and treatment planning. While\\nreasoning outputs are generally reliable, with factuality scores exceeding 90%,\\ncritical reasoning steps are frequently missed.

Recently, there were\\nattempts to distill the vast knowledge of LLMs into information retrieval\\nsystems. Those distillation methods mostly use output probabilities of LLMs\\nwhich are unavailable in the latest black-box LLMs. We propose Syntriever, a\\ntraining framework for retrievers using synthetic data from black-box LLMs.\\nSyntriever consists of two stages.

LLM is asked to self-verify the\\nsynthetic data for possible hallucinations, after which retrievers are trained\\nwith a loss designed to cluster the embeddings of relevant passages. Secondly\\nin the alignment stage, we align the retriever with the preferences of LLMs. We\\npropose a preference modeling called partial Plackett-Luce ranking to learn LLM\\npreferences with regularization which prevents the model from deviating\\nexcessively from that trained in the distillation stage.

However, existing code\\nbenchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined\\nproblems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where\\nLLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems,\\nleading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address\\nthese issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that\\novercomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs\\nsystematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code\\ncomplexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity,\\ngenerating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct\\nlevels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs.\\nResults on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7%\\ncompared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance\\nprogressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's\\nability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call\\ngraphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for\\nhandling subfunction interactions within nested code.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-12-02\\nTitle: HackSynth: LLM Agent and Evaluation Framework for Autonomous Penetration Testing\\nAuthors: Lajos Muzsai, David Imolai, András Lukács\\nSummary: We introduce HackSynth, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent\\ncapable of autonomous penetration testing.

However, current single-agent work\\nlacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low\\nefficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking\\nAgents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement\\nLearning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think\\nabout thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical\\nagents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic\\noversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions.\\nThrough iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents\\nexplore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and\\nrobustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent\\nRL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level\\nmathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation\\nstudies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent,\\nproviding valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process\\nenhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-25\\nTitle: MEMERAG: A Multilingual End-to-End Meta-Evaluation Benchmark for Retrieval Augmented Generation\\nAuthors: María Andrea Cruz Blandón, Jayasimha Talur, Bruno Charron, Dong Liu, Saab Mansour, Marcello Federico\\nSummary: Automatic evaluation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems relies\\non fine-grained dimensions like faithfulness and relevance, as judged by expert\\nhuman annotators. Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of\\nautomatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However,\\nexisting benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data,\\nwhich fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better\\nrepresentation of the end user experience.\\n  In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG\\nbenchmark (MEMERAG). Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using\\nnative-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language\\nmodels (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness\\nand relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves\\nhigh inter-annotator agreement. We then analyse the performance of the\\nanswer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators. Finally we\\napply the dataset to our main use-case which is to benchmark multilingual\\nautomatic evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). We show that our benchmark can reliably\\nidentify improvements offered by advanced prompting techniques and LLMs. We\\nwill release our benchmark to support the community developing accurate\\nevaluation methods for multilingual RAG systems.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-14\\nTitle: Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs\\nAuthors: Minsang Kim, Seungjun Baek\\nSummary: LLMs have boosted progress in many AI applications.

We conduct a detailed analysis of failure recovery\\nstatistical properties, temporal patterns, co-occurrence, and the impact range\\nof outage-causing incidents.

Our benchmark comprises tasks across\\nfour categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally\\nunsolvable tasks to test hallucination rejection. We develop an LLM-as-Judge\\nevaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference\\nimplementations. Results show Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o achieve the best overall\\nperformance, with Claude models excelling on solvable tasks while OpenAI models\\nbetter identify unsolvable scenarios.
