## Using GitHub Codespaces to Run Jupyter Notebooks
GitHub Codespaces provides a streamlined, cloud-based development environment. To get started with Jupyter notebooks in Codespaces:

1. Open the repository on GitHub and click the "Code" button.  
2. Select "Open with Codespaces" to launch or create a new Codespace.  
3. In the Codespace terminal, install the necessary dependencies:  
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
4. Start the Jupyter Notebook server with the following command:  
    jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser  
5. Use the generated URL to access the notebook interface in your browser.  

This setup allows you to experiment interactively without any local configuration.
