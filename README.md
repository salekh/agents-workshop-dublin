• Modular design for easy expansion and testing  
• Clear examples that demonstrate agent-based workflows

## Repository Structure
- Exercise 1: Building Opinionated Agents with the Azure AI Agent Service
- Exercise 2: Building a Researcher Agent with Autogen and Magentic One  

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agents-workshop-dublin.git  
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
    cd agents-workshop-dublin

To begin working, open the repository on GitHub, click the "Code" button, and select "Open with Codespaces". The environment is preconfigured via a devcontainer, so no additional dependency installation is needed.


## Using GitHub Codespaces to Run Jupyter Notebooks
GitHub Codespaces provides a streamlined, cloud-based development environment. To get started with Jupyter notebooks in Codespaces:

1. Open the repository on GitHub and click the "Code" button.  
2. Select "Open with Codespaces" to launch or create a new Codespace.  
3. The Codespace will automatically set up the environment, including installing dependencies.  
4. Navigate to the Jupyter notebook and try to run any og the cells by clicking on it and pressing Shift + Enter.  
5. This will automatically give you the option to select a kernel. Choose the one that matches your environment (in this case, Python 3.10).
